# Final-Project-for-INFO-697
The final project code for INFO-697, based on BBC Micro:bit, written by Python

To get start with this game, do the following:

- In this game, the only thing that you need to interact with is a joystick module. 
- In order to win the game, you need to use the joystick to move to the sound source spot.
- When the game begins, you can hear serials of beeping sounds from the buzzer module. 
- You will notice that the beeping sounds will change when you interact with the joystick.
- The beeping sound is the indicator of the direction with the sound source: When the sound’s pitch gets higher and the rhythm gets faster, the distance between you and the sound source is closer, and vice versa.
- If you’re too far away with the target spot, the Micro:bit will play sad music, which means you lose. If you’re in the right location, the Micro:bit will play happy music to indicate you win. You can reset the game to play it again if you hear those music.
- Try to interact with the joystick and find out the sound source and enjoy the game! You can reset the game anytime while you press the reset button.
